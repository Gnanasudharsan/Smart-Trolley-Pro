Smart Trolley with RSSI-Based Navigation and RFID Billing System

üìú Project Description

This project presents an innovative Smart Trolley designed to revolutionize shopping by reducing physical effort and streamlining the billing process. The trolley autonomously follows customers using Wi-Fi RSSI tracking and OpenCV-based person detection, while an RFID system handles real-time billing. The system is powered by Raspberry Pi and integrates sensors for collision avoidance, ensuring a smooth shopping experience.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Autonomous Navigation: Follows customers using Wi-Fi RSSI and a camera module.
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Person Detection: Tracks customers with OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite.
	‚Ä¢	Instant Billing: RFID system calculates and displays the total cost of items.
	‚Ä¢	Collision Avoidance: Integrated sensors prevent obstacles and ensure smooth navigation.
	‚Ä¢	Efficient Power Usage: Designed for optimal battery performance with a 12V rechargeable battery.
